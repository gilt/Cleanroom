# The Cleanroom Project

The Cleanroom Project is an experiment in re-imagining Gilt's iOS codebase in a legacy-free incarnation that embraces the latest Apple technology.

We'll be tracking the most up-to-date releases of Swift, iOS and Xcode, and we'll be open-sourcing major portions of our code as we go.
