# The Cleanroom Project

The Cleanroom Project is an experiment in re-imagining Gilt's iOS codebase in a legacy-free incarnation that embraces the latest Apple technology.

We'll be tracking the most up-to-date releases of Swift, iOS and Xcode, and we'll be open-sourcing major portions of our code as we go.

## Available Repositories

The Cleanroom Project is spread across several repositories, and we expect the list to continue growing. This page will serve as the definitive index for the available Cleanroom Project repos.

### Core Application

- [CleanroomBase](http://github.com/emaloney/CleanroomBase) — Low-level utilities useful for developing Swift-based iOS applications
- [CleanroomASL](http://github.com/emaloney/CleanroomASL) — A Swift-based API for reading from & writing to the Apple System Log (more commonly known somewhat inaccurately as "the console")
- [CleanroomLogger](http://github.com/emaloney/CleanroomLogger) — A simple Swift-based logging API for iOS applications

### Avro Serialization

- [BlueSteel](https://github.com/gilt/BlueSteel) — A Swift API for working with Avro schemas and binary data

## Contributing to the Cleanroom Project

We welcome contributions to all the various Cleanroom Project repositories.

Contributing can take many forms, but to make administering the process easier, we handle all contributions in one of two ways:

### Making Suggestions &amp; Pointing Out Problems

Such contributions include:

- Reporting bugs
- Sending feature requests
- Pointing out typos

For these types of contributions, **please create a [GitHub Issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) in the appropriate repo** containing the message that you'd like to convey.

### Improving the Codebase

This would include:

- Fixing bugs
- Tweaking project file settings
- Writing unit tests
- Submitting performance and other code improvements
- Adding new features

To contribute in this way, **please [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)** by:

1. [Forking the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) to which you'd like to submit a contribution
2. Committing changes to your fork
3. Pushing your changes to GitHub
4. Submitting a pull request from your changes

If your pull request is related to something already tracked in a GitHub Issue, please be sure to note the issue number (and include a link to the issue page) in your pull request.

### Licensing

By submitting a pull request, you inherently grant Gilt a license to redistribute your work under the same license that governs the repository to which you're contributing.
